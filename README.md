 The Data flow through the application from client to server to MongoDatabase is straight forward and
 well explained by the instructors   but  need more practise how things are working .

1.) Didn't get  what does  the headers(content-type)  means in post sighting method?
 and also( body: json => Is POST method sighting form is sending request to server in  the form JSON ?
 
2.) what   json.stringify  will do?

3.)Didn't get how the eventBus On is working in App.vue . Is it  using response fetch data from get method ?
